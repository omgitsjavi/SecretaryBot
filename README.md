## SecretaryBot

SecretaryBot, or SBot for short, is a simple information management program built from the ground up in Python. It will have modules added to it over time for a variety of tasks.

SBot can be run as a standalone .exe (located in the "dist" folder) without having to install Python thanks to PyInstaller!

Please note that, due to the way user profiles are created and loaded, you'll want to run SBot in a self-contained folder.
